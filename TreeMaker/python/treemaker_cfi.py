# Description: Writes ntuples (ROOT tree) for RA2Classic analysis
#
# The following variables are stored in the tree:
#  - "RunNum": run number (UInt_t)
#  - "LumiBlockNum": luminosity block number (UInt_t)
#  - "EvtNum": event number (UInt_t)
#  - "NumVtx": number of vertices (UShort_t)
#  - "HT": HT (Float_t)
#  - "NJets": number of jets (UShort_t)
#  - "Jet?Pt": pt of jet ?, where ? = 1,2,3 (Float_t)
#  - "Jet?Eta": eta of jet ?, where ? = 1,2,3 (Float_t)
#  - "MHT": MHT (Float_t)
#  - "DeltaPhi?": deltaPhi between jet ? and MHT, where ? = 1,2,3 (Float_t)
#
# The following optional variables are stored in the tree
#  - "<VarsDouble_X>": numbers. They are expected to be stored in double-
#                         precision in the event but kept in Float_t-precision
#                         in the tree (Float_t)
#  - "<CandidateNameX>": where X = N, Pt, Eta, Phi. In case of Pt, Eta, Phi, these are
#                        arrays storing these kinematic information for N candidates.   
#  - "CandidateCollections": list of InputTags for edm::Candidate collections
#                  stored in the event. The kinematic information of each candidate
#                  are stored in an array of Float_t variables in the tree with
#                  the names given in '<CandidateNamesInTree>' or, if this is not
#                  specified, as '<InputTag::label()>'.
